### Notes

* I followed the lab today and rewatched the lecture.  It was too late for I couldn't connect slack to remo to submit the ticket.  I feel like I had a pretty good understanding of the lesson and the lab, but the pull request failed.  I tried to troubleshoot as much as I could but I'm submitting now so I dont hit the deadline.
